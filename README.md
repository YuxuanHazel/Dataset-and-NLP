This repository is for final project of module Dataset and NLP, containing scripts and resources for processing political text data and fine-tuning transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, BART, and a custom POLITICS model) and K-Means clustering to predict political orientation.

Repository Structure
  0-shot evaluation/: Scripts for evaluating the original performance of models.
  Data cleaning and spliting/: Scripts for data cleaning and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
  
  Fine_tuning/: Scripts for fine-tuning BERT, RoBERTa, BART, and the custom POLITICS model. (P.S.: The fine-tuned model is too large to upload to GitHub, so it is stored locally.)
  
  Prediction/: Scripts for evaluating model performance on downstream task.

  SHAP: Scripts for model explainability and visualization of the result
